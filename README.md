# SparsemaxPytorch


Implementation in PyTorch of http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/martins16.pdf (International Conference on Machine Learning 2016)

This repository contains codes of sparsemax mainly developed by Max Raphael Sobroza Marques. I updated a few lines of codes for compatibility with pytorch 0.4.
